Our lovely Insta Divas are looking for something extra cute to wear today! While searching for some inspiration, they have come upon the #strapskirt trend. Now isn't this just the cutest thing to wear this season? The possibilities are endless. There are just so many designs such as high or low waist, a-line or pencil skirt, with wide, narrow, double or ruffled straps, single-colored or with lovely floral, tartan prints and so much more! Open the wardrobes, pick the strap skirt you love, and find a matching t-shirt, crop top, or blouse, a cute jacket and show off your #strapskirt outfit looks! Have fun playing this game here at Y8.com!
